# Solution Blueprint

This directory contains a template for creating a new solution.

To create a new solution, copy this directory and place it inside the corresponding problem's directory (e.g., `data/contests/C0/problems/C0A/`). Then, update the files inside to match the new solution.

The structure of a solution directory is as follows:

-   `solution.c`, `solution.cpp`, `solution.py`: The solution code in different languages.
-   `solution.md`: An explanation of the solution approach.
-   `solution.pdf`: The compiled PDF version of the solution (optional).
-   `solution.tex`: The LaTeX source file for the solution explanation.
-   `validator.py`: A script to validate the output of the solution. This is optional and is only needed if there are multiple correct outputs for a problem.
