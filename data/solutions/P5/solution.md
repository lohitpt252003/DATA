## Problem Description
The problem requires adding two very large non-negative integers, $a$ and $b$.

## Simple Answer
The approach is to simulate manual addition, digit by digit, from right to left, handling carries.

## Detailed Explanation
To add two very large numbers, we simulate manual addition, digit by digit, from right to left, handling carries. This approach is necessary because standard integer types in most programming languages cannot hold numbers as large as $10^{1e5}$. Therefore, the numbers are typically processed as sequences of digits (e.g., strings or arrays of integers).

We iterate from their least significant digits (rightmost) to their most significant digits (leftmost). We maintain a $carry$ variable. For each position, we add the corresponding digits from the two numbers ($a$ and $b$) (if they exist) and the $carry$ from the previous step. The sum's unit digit becomes part of the result, and the tens digit becomes the new $carry$. This process continues until all digits have been processed and there is no remaining carry. Finally, the result, which was built in reverse, is reversed to get the correct order.

### Input/Output Format
The input consists of two lines, each containing a non-negative integer ($a$ and $b$). The output should be a single line containing their sum. Since the numbers can be very large, they are typically read and printed as strings.

### Constraints and Data Types
The problem specifies that $a$ and $b$ are less than $10^{1e5}$. This means they can have up to $10^5$ digits. Standard integer types (like `int` or `long long` in C/C++) cannot store such large numbers, as they typically handle up to about 18-19 digits. Therefore, the numbers must be handled as strings or arrays of digits. Python's arbitrary-precision integers can handle these numbers directly, but the problem often implies implementing the addition logic manually.

### Python
Python's string manipulation and list operations make this straightforward. We can convert characters to integers, perform addition, and convert back to characters. The `//` operator for integer division and `%` for modulo are useful for carry and current digit calculation.

```python
a = input()
b = input()

def addStrings(a: str, b: str) -> str:
    res = []
    i, j = len(a) - 1, len(b) - 1
    carry = 0
    while i >= 0 or j >= 0 or carry:
        n1 = int(a[i]) if i >= 0 else 0
        n2 = int(b[j]) if j >= 0 else 0
        
        current_sum = n1 + n2 + carry
        carry = current_sum // 10
        res.append(str(current_sum % 10))
        
        i -= 1
        j -= 1
    return "".join(res[::-1])

print(addStrings(a, b))
```

### C++
In C++, we can use `std::string` to represent the numbers. Iterating from right to left, converting `char` to `int` (by subtracting '0'), performing arithmetic, and converting back to `char` (by adding '0') is the standard approach. `std::reverse` from `<algorithm>` is used to reverse the result string.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm> // For std::reverse

std::string addStrings(std::string a, std::string b) {
    std::string res = "";
    int i = a.length() - 1, j = b.length() - 1, carry = 0;
    while (i >= 0 || j >= 0 || carry) {
        int n1 = (i >= 0) ? a[i--] - '0' : 0;
        int n2 = (j >= 0) ? b[j--] - '0' : 0;
        int sum = n1 + n2 + carry;
        res += std::to_string(sum % 10);
        carry = sum / 10;
    }
    std::reverse(res.begin(), res.end());
    return res;
}

int main() {
    std::string a, b;
    std::cin >> a >> b;
    std::cout << addStrings(a, b) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### C
In C, we use character arrays (`char[]`) to store the numbers. String manipulation functions like `strlen` and manual iteration are necessary. A helper function to reverse the result string is typically implemented.

```c
#include <stdio.h> 
#include <string.h> 
#include <stdlib.h> 

// Function to reverse a string
void reverse(char* str) {
    int len = strlen(str);
    int i, j;
    char temp;
    for (i = 0, j = len - 1; i < j; i++, j--) {
        temp = str[i];
        str[i] = str[j];
        str[j] = temp;
    }
}

int main() {
    char a[100005], b[100005];
    scanf("%s", a);
    scanf("%s", b);

    char result[100006]; // Max length + 1 for carry + null terminator
    int i = strlen(a) - 1;
    int j = strlen(b) - 1;
    int k = 0; // index for result
    int carry = 0;

    while (i >= 0 || j >= 0 || carry) {
        int n1 = (i >= 0) ? (a[i] - '0') : 0;
        int n2 = (j >= 0) ? (b[j] - '0') : 0;

        int sum = n1 + n2 + carry;
        result[k++] = (sum % 10) + '0';
        carry = sum / 10;

        i--;
        j--;
    }
    result[k] = '\0'; // Null-terminate the string

    reverse(result);
    printf("%s\n", result);

    return 0;
}
