## Solution Approach for Large Number Subtraction

This problem requires subtracting two potentially very large integers that may exceed the capacity of standard integer data types. The approach involves treating the numbers as strings and implementing subtraction logic similar to how one would perform it manually.

### Key Considerations:

1.  **Sign Handling:** Determine the sign of the result based on the magnitudes and signs of the input numbers. For example, $5 - 10 = -5$, and $-5 - (-10) = 5$.
2.  **Magnitude Comparison:** Compare the absolute magnitudes of the two numbers to decide which number to subtract from which. For instance, to calculate $A - B$, if $|A| < |B|$, then $A - B = -(|B| - |A|)$.
3.  **Digit-by-Digit Subtraction:** Perform subtraction digit by digit from right to left, handling borrowing as necessary.
4.  **Leading Zeros:** Ensure the final result does not have unnecessary leading zeros (unless the result is zero itself).

### Example (Python):

Python's arbitrary-precision integers simplify this problem significantly, as `int` can handle numbers of any size. The solution simply involves converting the input strings to integers and performing the subtraction directly.

```python
def solve():
    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())
    print(a - b)

solve()
```

### Example (C++/C - Conceptual):

For languages like C++ or C, a custom implementation for large number arithmetic is required. This typically involves:

1.  **Representing Numbers:** Store large numbers as strings or arrays of digits.
2.  **Helper Functions:** Implement functions for:
    *   `is_smaller(num1, num2)`: Compares two positive numbers represented as strings.
    *   `add_positive(num1, num2)`: Adds two positive numbers represented as strings.
    *   `subtract_positive(num1, num2)`: Subtracts two positive numbers (assuming `num1 >= num2`) represented as strings.
3.  **Main Subtraction Logic:** Combine these helper functions with logic to handle the signs of the input numbers and determine the sign of the final result.

**Note:** The provided C++ and C solutions are simplified placeholders using `stoll` and `atoll` respectively, which are suitable only for numbers that fit within `long long`. A full solution for arbitrary precision would be much more complex.
