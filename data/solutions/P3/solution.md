## Problem Description
The problem asks us to multiply two integers, `a` and `b`. We can read the two integers from standard input, multiply them, and then print the result to standard output.

## Simple Answer
The simplest approach is to read the two integers and directly compute their product.

## Detailed Explanation
The core of this problem is performing integer multiplication. Most programming languages provide a built-in multiplication operator (`*`) that handles this directly.

### Python
In Python, we can read the two space-separated integers using `input().split()`, convert them to integers using `map(int, ...)`, and then print their product.

```python
a, b = map(int, input().split())
print(a * b)
```

### C++
In C++, we can use `std::cin` to read the two integers and `std::cout` to print their product. Ensure to include the `<iostream>` header.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int a, b;
    std::cin >> a >> b;
    std::cout << a * b << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### C
In C, we can use `scanf` to read the two integers and `printf` to print their product. Ensure to include the `<stdio.h>` header.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int a, b;
    scanf("%d %d", &a, &b);
    printf("%d\n", a * b);
    return 0;
}
```
