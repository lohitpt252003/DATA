The function traces the steps of the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor.

Here is the trace for A=48 and B=18:
1. `func(48, 18)`: Since A > B, this calls `func(18, 48-18)`, which is `func(18, 30)`.
2. `func(18, 30)`: Since A < B, this calls `func(18, 30-18)`, which is `func(18, 12)`.
3. `func(18, 12)`: Since A > B, this calls `func(12, 18-12)`, which is `func(12, 6)`.
4. `func(12, 6)`: Since A > B, this calls `func(6, 12-6)`, which is `func(6, 6)`.
5. `func(6, 6)`: Since A = B, the function returns A, which is `6`.
