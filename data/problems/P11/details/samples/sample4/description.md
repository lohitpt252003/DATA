Here is the trace for A=250 and B=75:
1. `func(250, 75)`: Since A > B, this calls `func(75, 175)`.
2. `func(75, 175)`: Since A < B, this calls `func(75, 100)`.
3. `func(75, 100)`: Since A < B, this calls `func(75, 25)`.
4. `func(75, 25)`: Since A > B, this calls `func(25, 50)`.
5. `func(25, 50)`: Since A < B, this calls `func(25, 25)`.
6. `func(25, 25)`: Since A = B, the function returns A, which is `25`.
