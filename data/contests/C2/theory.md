# Theory Behind the `Number Theory - Divisibility` contestðŸ§ 

The `Number Theory - Divisibility` `(C1)` focuses on fundamental concepts in **divisibility** and **modular arithmetic**. Key concepts include:

* **Basic Divisibility & Parity:** Understanding how numbers can be divisible by others and identifying odd or even numbers.
* **Factors and Divisors:** Learning how to find all divisors of a number efficiently.
* **Modular Arithmetic:** Working with remainders and understanding properties of numbers under modulo operations.
* **Subset and Sum Properties:** Grasping how sums and products behave under modular constraints.
* **Partitioning and Remainder Sets:** Understanding properties of numbers when dividing sequences into segments and analyzing their modular characteristics.

These concepts are foundational for developing strong problem-solving skills in algorithms and competitive programming.
