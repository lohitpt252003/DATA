### Problem

Print all prime numbers between two given numbers, for several test cases.

### Input

The first line contains an integer t, the number of test cases. Then follow t lines, each containing two integers m and n (1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 10^9, n − m ≤ 100000).

For each test case, print all prime numbers p such that m ≤ p ≤ n, one per line. Separate the output for different test cases with a blank line.

### Output

For each test case, print the primes in the range, one per line. Print a blank line between test cases.

### Constraints

1 ≤ t ≤ 10
1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 10^9
n − m ≤ 100000
