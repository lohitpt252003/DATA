## Description

Given `$n$` integers, your task is to report for each integer the number of its divisors.

For example, if `$x = 18$`, the correct answer is `$6$` because its divisors are `$1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18$`.

### Input

The first input line has an integer `$n$`: the number of integers.
After this, there are `$n$` lines, each containing an integer `$x$`.

### Output

For each integer, print the number of its divisors on a separate line.

### Constraints

$1 \le n \le 10^5$
$1 \le x \le 10^6$
