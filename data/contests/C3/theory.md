# Theory Behind the `Number Theory - gcd, lcm, prime numbers, sieve algo, modular arithmetic` contest 🧠

The `Number Theory - gcd, lcm, prime numbers, sieve algo, modular arithmetic` contest focuses on several key areas of number theory:

*   **Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) and Least Common Multiple (LCM):** Understanding algorithms like Euclidean algorithm for GCD, and the relationship between GCD and LCM.
*   **Prime Numbers:** Properties of prime numbers, primality testing, and factorization.
*   **Sieve Algorithms:** Efficiently finding prime numbers up to a given limit, such as the Sieve of Eratosthenes.
*   **Modular Arithmetic:** Operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) in modular systems, modular inverse, Fermat's Little Theorem, Euler's Totient Theorem.

These topics are essential for solving a wide range of algorithmic problems in competitive programming.
