## Description

You will be given t number of testcases, and then for each testcase, generate a random number between a and b (both inclusive).

## Input

The first line contains an integer $t$, the number of testcases.
Each of the following $t$ lines contains two integers $a$ and $b$.

## Output

For each testcase, output a random integer $x$ such that $a \le x \le b$.

## Constraints

- $1 \le t \le 100$
- $-10^8 \le a \le b \le 10^{18}$

## Notes

The generated random number must be within the inclusive range $[a, b]$.
