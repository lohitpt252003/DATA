# Number Theory - gcd, lcm, prime numbers, sieve algo, modular arithmetic Practice Contest

## Description
This practice contest focuses on fundamental concepts in Number Theory, including:
- Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)
- Least Common Multiple (LCM)
- Properties of prime numbers
- Sieve algorithms (e.g., Sieve of Eratosthenes)
- Modular arithmetic operations and properties

Participants will encounter problems designed to test their understanding and application of these core number theory principles.
