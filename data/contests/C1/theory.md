# Theory Behind the Genesis Contest

The problems in this contest are designed to cover basic algorithmic concepts such as:

*   **Input/Output Handling:** Reading data from standard input and writing to standard output.
*   **Conditional Statements:** Using `if-else` structures to make decisions.
*   **Basic Arithmetic:** Performing addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
*   **Finding Maximum/Minimum:** Identifying the largest or smallest among a set of numbers.

These fundamental concepts are crucial for building more complex algorithms and solving advanced problems in competitive programming.
